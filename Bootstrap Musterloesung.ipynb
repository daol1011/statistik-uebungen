    "Wir schauen uns erneut den Datensatz des Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) an, siehe Übung \"Einführung in das Thema Daten\". Wenn man Zugang zu den Daten einer gesamten Population hat, z.B. Alter, Größe, Gewicht, und Tabakkonsum *aller* Erwachsenen eines Landes, ist es einfach, Fragen wie \"Wie viel Prozent der Erwachsenen haben in ihrem Leben mehr als 100 Zigaretten geraucht?\"\n",
    "Man könnte dann auch untersuchen, ob und wie sich dieses Verhalten z.B. bei jungen und alten Erwachsenen unterscheidet. Wenn Sie nur Zugang zu einer Stichprobe der Bevölkerung haben, was häufig der Fall ist, wird die Aufgabe komplizierter. Was ist Ihre beste Schätzung für diesen Anteil der (ehemaligen oder aktuellen) Raucher, wenn Sie nur Daten von einer kleinen Stichprobe von Erwachsenen haben? In einer solchen Situation müssen Sie die Stichprobe nutzen, um Rückschlüsse auf die Grundgesamtheit zu ziehen.\n",

    "Das Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) ist eine jährliche Telefonumfrage bei 350 000 Personen in den Vereinigten Staaten. Wie der Name schon sagt, dient das BRFSS der Ermittlung von Risikofaktoren in der erwachsenen Bevölkerung und der Meldung neuer Gesundheitstrends. So werden die Befragten beispielsweise nach ihrer Ernährung und ihrer wöchentlichen körperlichen Aktivität, ihrem HIV/AIDS-Status, möglichem Tabakkonsum und nach ihrem Krankenversicherungsschutz gefragt. Die [Website] der BRFSS (http://www.cdc.gov/brfss) enthält eine vollständige Beschreibung der Erhebung, einschließlich der Forschungsfragen, die der Studie zugrunde liegen, und vieler interessanter Ergebnisse, die aus den Daten abgeleitet wurden.\n",

    "Wir werden uns auf eine Zufallsstichprobe von 20.000 Personen aus der BRFSS-Erhebung aus dem Jahr 2000 konzentrieren. Obwohl dieser Datensatz über 200 Variablen enthält, werden wir mit einer kleinen Teilmenge arbeiten.\n",

    "Wenn Sie die vorherige Zelle mehrmals hintereinander ausführen, werden Sie feststellen, dass jedes Mal eine andere Menge von 100 Datensätzen ausgewählt wird -- zufällig eben. Dies macht die Vergleichbarkeit von Ergebnissen schwierig, daher übergeben wir den Parameter `random_state`. Dies kann eine beliebige ganze Zahl (z.B. [42](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(Antwort))) sein und sorgt dafür, dass bei jedem Ausführen die *gleiche* zufällige Stichprobe ausgewählt wird. Überzeugen Sie sich davon, indem Sie die folgende Zelle mehrfach ausführen. Wir arbeiten ab sofort mit dieser Stichprobe weiter und tun so, als wären das die Daten, die wir kennen und als seien uns die restlichen 19900 Datenpunkte nicht bekannt."
